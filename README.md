# CS50AI Project Portfolio

Welcome to my CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python project portfolio! This course, offered by Harvard University, delves into the foundational concepts and algorithms of modern artificial intelligence (AI). It explores the ideas behind technologies such as game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, machine translation, and more. Through hands-on projects, students gain practical experience in implementing AI techniques using Python while learning the theoretical underpinnings of topics like graph search algorithms, optimization, machine learning, and neural networks.

By the end of the course, students are equipped with knowledge of AI principles and experience in using libraries for machine learning, enabling them to design intelligent systems.

* **Degrees**: Develop an AI to determine the "degrees of separation" between two actors using graph search algorithms
* **Tic-Tac-Toe**: Implement an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally using the Minimax algorithm

### 2. Knowledge
* **Knights**: Solve logic puzzles using propositional logic and model checking
* **Minesweeper**: Create an AI that plays Minesweeper by applying logical inference

### 3. Uncertainty
* **PageRank**: Build an AI to rank web pages by importance using probability-based methods
* **Heredity**: Develop an AI to predict the likelihood of genetic traits based on Bayesian networks

### 4. Optimization
* **Crossword**: Write an AI to generate crossword puzzles by solving constraint satisfaction problems

### 5. Learning
* **Shopping**: Predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase using supervised learning techniques
* **Nim**: Implement reinforcement learning to create an AI that teaches itself to play Nim

### 6. Neural Networks
* **Traffic**: Train a convolutional neural network to identify traffic signs from images

### 7. Language
* **Parser**: Create an AI that parses sentences to extract noun phrases
* **Attention**: Implement a computational model that simulates the concept of attention, often used in deep learning, to improve the focus and weighting of inputs for tasks like natural language processing or image recognition.
